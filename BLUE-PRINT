App Name: Web3Connect

Purpose:

A mobile-first application that allows users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps), manage cryptocurrency wallets, and perform blockchain transactions on the Ethereum network.

Features:

1. Wallet Management

Create New Wallet: Generate a new Ethereum wallet (private and public keys).

Import Existing Wallet: Import a wallet using a private key or mnemonic phrase.

View Wallet Balance: Check ETH and token balances (ERC-20 tokens).

Transaction History: View transaction history with details (sent/received).



2. Web3 Integration

Connect to dApps: Interact with decentralized applications directly from the app (e.g., DeFi, NFT marketplaces).

Sign Transactions: Sign and broadcast Ethereum transactions (e.g., sending ETH or tokens).

Token Interaction: Buy, sell, and send ERC-20 tokens or NFTs.



3. QR Code Scanning

Scan Wallet Address: Scan QR codes to send tokens or view wallet details.

Scan Payment Requests: Receive payments by scanning payment QR codes.



4. dApp Browser

Web3 Browser: Built-in browser for exploring decentralized websites and services.

dApp Directory: Access a curated list of popular dApps (DeFi, NFTs, and games).



5. Security

Keystore Encryption: Secure storage of private keys using Android’s Keystore.

Pin/Password Protection: Optional screen lock for extra security.

Biometric Authentication: Optional fingerprint or face recognition for signing transactions.



6. Push Notifications

Transaction Updates: Notify users about successful/failed transactions.

dApp Alerts: Get alerts for dApp interactions or offers.




Tech Stack:

Frontend: Kotlin/Java (Android)

Web3 Integration: Web3j library (for Ethereum network interaction)

Backend (optional): Firebase for user authentication and data storage

Database: Room for local wallet storage

Authentication: Google Firebase, or MetaMask authentication for decentralized identity


Screens/Flow:

1. Welcome Screen:

Option to create a new wallet or import an existing wallet.



2. Home Screen:

Display balance and recent transactions.

Access wallet, settings, and dApp browser.



3. Wallet Screen:

View balance and send/receive ETH and ERC-20 tokens.

Transaction history and address management.



4. dApp Browser:

Built-in Web3 browser to explore dApps.

Search bar for finding specific dApps.



5. Settings Screen:

Manage wallet, security options, push notifications, and app preferences.




Security Considerations:

Private Key Management: Use Android Keystore system to securely store private keys.

Transaction Signing: Use a secure method to sign transactions locally without exposing private keys.

Data Privacy: Ensure sensitive data (such as private keys and user information) is not transmitted to third-party servers.
